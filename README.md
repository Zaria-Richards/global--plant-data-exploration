# Exploration Data Analysis: Global Power Plant Dataset

## Project Overview

### Dataset Used
**Global Power Plant Database**

the data set contains information on power plants arounf the world, including:
- Plants Location
- Primary Fuel type
- Capacity (megawatts)
- Country and regional metadata

the dataset includes a mix and numerical and catigorcal feature and contains missing values, making it suitable or EDA practice.

### What Was Done

Within the notbook the following steps where done:

- Loaded and inspected dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
- Review columns names and features trypes
- Analyzed missing values across columns
- Computed summery statistics for merical features
- Visualized
  - Frequency of primary fuel types
  - Missing values per column
 
The focus is on **understanding the dataset**, not cleaning or modeling.
